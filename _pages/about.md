![Hi](/images/фото 1.png)

I am a fourth-year student at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (Computer Science track). My passion is data analysis, mathematical optimization and modelling.

I am a junior Data Scientist at Ozon and researcher at MIPT and Skoltech laboratories.



Apart from academia and data science, I am passionate about helping schoolchildren with admission to the best Russian technical universities. Checkout my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1uHZnZPsxDpSYlerkdTvXA) (in Russian).
