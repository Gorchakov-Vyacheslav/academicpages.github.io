I am a fourth-year student at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (Computer Science track). My passion is data analysis, mathematical optimization and modelling. My main experience lies in domains of statistics, optimization and data analysis. I dedicate a great time for self-learning as well as discovering applications of math issues on the real-world problems.

Now I am a junior Data Scientist at Ozon and researcher at MIPT and Skoltech laboratories.



Apart from academia and data science, I am passionate about helping schoolchildren with admission to the best Russian technical universities. Checkout my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1uHZnZPsxDpSYlerkdTvXA) (in Russian).

Also I am a big fan of football, therefore I play at MIPT football team and [here](https://mipt.nagradion.ru/player/335569) is my statistics.
